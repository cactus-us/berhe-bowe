<h1 id="about-title">Our Story</h1>

<div id="about-separation">
    <p id="about-par-1">We are a family-owned Italian restaurant that has been proud to serve the Villanova area for over 75 years. Luigi was our original founder. He opened the original Bryn Mawr location in 1948 after immigrating to America with his wife, Francesca. After the restaurant’s establishment as a Bryn Mawr staple, the second St. Davids location followed in 1973. The third Ardmore location was added in 2003. Luigi was in charge of the restaurants until his unfortunate passing in 2013. His sons, Nick, Luigi Jr., and Paul, took over one restaurant each. They are shown left to right in this picture. Nick now runs the Bryn Mawr location, Luigi Jr. the St. Davids location, and Paul the Ardmore location.</p>
