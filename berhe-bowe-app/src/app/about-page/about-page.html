<h1 id="about-title">Our Story</h1>

<div id="about-separation">
    <p id="about-par-1">We are a family-owned Italian restaurant that has been proud to serve the Villanova area for over 75 years. Luigi was our original founder. He opened the original Bryn Mawr location in 1948 after immigrating to America with his wife, Francesca. The restaurant was a total success and soon became a Bryn Mawr staple. Our second location in St. Davids followed in 1973, and the third location in Ardmore was added in 2003. Luigi was the culinary vision behind the restaurants until his unfortunate passing in 2013. The picture to the right depicts his sons, Nick, Luigi Jr., and Paul, (L to R). Nick now runs the original Bryn Mawr location, Luigi Jr. the St. Davids location, and Paul the Ardmore location. All have a passion for Italian cuisine and carrying on their father's legacy. They are excited for each of their children to inherit the family business.</p>

<p class="about-paragraph">We specialize in Italian comfort food. Our menu features all the classic Italian-American dishes, like chicken parmesan, baked ziti, and spaghetti + meatballs. We also feature Luigi’s favorite dish, appropriately called Luigi’s Signature Pasta. Our expert chefs make all of our pasta fresh, and the bakers make all the desserts in-house.
