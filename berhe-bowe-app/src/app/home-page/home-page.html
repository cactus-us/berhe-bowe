<h1 class="title">Welcome to Luigi's!</h1>

<p class="paragraph">We are a family-owned restaurant that has been proud to serve the Villanova area for over 75 years. Our original founder was Luigi himself. Since his passing in 2011, his sons have gained ownership. They can be seen in the picture below. From left to right are Nick, Luigi Jr., and Paul.</p>
